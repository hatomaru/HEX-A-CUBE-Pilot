# HEX A CUBE – Pilot Version

HEX A CUBE is a puzzle game prototype focused on competitive tension
between the player and autonomous CPU opponents,
where reaching the goal first determines victory.

This repository contains a **pilot / prototype implementation**  
created as part of a short-term development challenge.

The goal of this pilot is **not to deliver a final product**,  
but to **verify core ideas, module composition, and development decisions**
that will connect to a future full-scale implementation.

## Overview

- **Type**: Pilot / Prototype
- **Development Period**: Short-term
- **Scope**: Core structure & module integration
- **Status**: Experimental / In-progress

This project focuses on **how individual modules are designed and combined**,  
rather than on content volume or final polish.

## Purpose of This Pilot

This pilot was created to verify the following points:

- Whether the core gameplay / system idea works as intended
- Whether the module structure allows flexible extension
- Whether short-term iteration can lead to a stable foundation for production

**Success criteria for this pilot**:
- Core loop can be executed
- Modules are loosely coupled and replaceable
- Future expansion points are clearly identified
